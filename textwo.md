I need you to convert python code into golang code. If there are @property methods, should that be a variable in the translated golang? DO NOT create structs like 'union' or 'dict', choose a data type that most accuratley represents any data structures that dont exist in golang. DO NOT IMPLEMENT ANY FUNCTIONS OR DATA STRUCTURES THAT ARE NOT EXPLICITLEY IMPLEMENTED IN THE CODE BELOW. Do not explain to me the code you give me. Create FULL implementations for each function of the python code. Define all of the functions. DO NOT DEFINE FUNCTIONS THAT ARE NOT DEFINED IN THE CODE BELOW, i've already implemented them, assume they are in the same package. Do not explain to me your decisions. Only give me the converted code. Use interfaces for abstract classes

Here is the code:
