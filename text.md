I'm converting a python package into golang.
Here is the github link to the whole package for reference: https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain
I want you to convert the '**call**()' function in this specific file of the project: https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/blob/master/langchain/chains/base.py

IMPLEMENT ALL OF THE FUNCTIONALITY THE PYTHON FUNCTION DEFINES
